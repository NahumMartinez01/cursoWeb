    <p>This sweet coleslaw recipe tastes like the slaw served at popular fried chicken or fish restaurants. It's excellent with burgers or on top of BBQ pork sandwiches, too!</p>

    

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) bag coleslaw mix</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons diced onion</li>
      <li>⅔ cup creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle Whip™)</li>
      <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white vinegar</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon poppy seeds</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

      <li>
       
        <p>
            Combine coleslaw mix and onion in a large bowl.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        
        <p>
            Whisk salad dressing, sugar, vegetable oil, vinegar, poppy seeds, and salt together in a medium bowl until blended. Pour dressing over coleslaw mixture and toss to coat.
        </p>
      </li>

            Chill for at least 2 hours before serving.
        </p>
      </li>

          Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the
          centers are a light pink color. Using a bench scraper or firm spatula,
          gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of
          them with cheese. Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the
          plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks.
          Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.
